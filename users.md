##User Management

Since user registration is completely optional, and it can be disabled inside [system settings](settings.html#auth), administrators (or users with appropriate permissions) can manually add, edit and remove system users.

###Updating User

Administrators can edit all user details, update their avatar and invalidate their active sessions. The form for editing user details is the same form that every user see when he edit his [Profile](profile.html), and the only difference is that user role and status can now be changed by administrator.
